# Why Consider Accessibility First?

A mobile-first approach ensures that a phone experience, which many users now prefer and use regularly, is prioritised and is great. It helps combat the natural tendency for the mobile experience to be left behind.

Similarly, an accessibility-first experience that the accessible experience, using screen readers and other assistive tech, is prioritised and is great.

But the benefit goes further. Developers can use the accessibility affordances to write automated tests. And if they ensure it’s accessible right away, it provides predictable ways to write the tests upfront.

## Consider your HTML, no matter your framework

HTML is not an after-thought, it’s not a ‘solved problem’, it’s not something you learn once and never have to study again. Especially in the world of web apps, it’s worth surveying the capabilities of today’s HTML and the affordances it can bring to every user.

## Accessibility Checklist for HTML

1. **Landmarks:** provide familiar touch points that users can jump to
2. **Semantics & Roles:** give every element semantic meaning
3. **Widgets:** allow everyone to use your controls
4. **Attributes:** sometimes sprinkling aria- attributes everywhere makes things less accessible
